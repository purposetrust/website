		<h1>Purpose Tru&#64262;</h1>
		<i>Purpose Trust is a legal structure for global platform companies.</i>

		<p>As an alternative to the Delaware C Corp, it's designed for businesses where rent extraction is less viable than creating value in and for the underlying assets - for example real estate, ride hailing, or farming.</p>

		<p>Its cooperative core leads to better decision making, while retaining the benefits of growth, swift decisions, and standardized operations across geographies. This is not without precedent: the world's largest fund manager, Vanguard, is run in a similar way, as are many other successful companies.</p>

		<p>The three core principles are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Sovereign</b>

			The Trust owns itself with a fiduciary duty to purpose and the local asset owners it provides services to. No rent extraction, no outside shareholders, no exit expectation.

			<li><b>Co-Determination</b>

			Labor, capital, and trustees have a carefully balanced equal say, with all three constituents forming the board, with veto powers, and labor being elected through unionization.

			<li><b>Subsidiarity</b>

			Maximise decision making and value creation on the local level without sacrificing functioning governance, with services and not authority flowing from the top down.
		</ul>

		<p>The modern economy is a marvel that brought us more than just the iPhone. But over-financialization and the hunt for extractive yields made capitalism not even work for many capitalists anymore. We need to be in this together again and re-align incentives.</p>

		<p>As we rebuild, we need to rebuild trust in our institutions, ourselves, and each other.</p>

		<p>Everything you need to start your own Purpose Trust will be available in the second half of 2020, in the meantime you can follow us on <a href="https://github.com/purposetrust" target="_blank">Github</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/purposetrust" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
